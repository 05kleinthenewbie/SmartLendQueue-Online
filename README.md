SmartLendQueue is an online borrowing system designed for the USTP Balubal Office, enabling students, faculty, and admins to manage item loans (e.g., projectors, chairs) in real time. Users log in, check item availability, and submit booking requests with details like name, department, and time slot. The system updates item statuses ("Available" or "Unavailable") dynamically, preventing double-booking, while admins can view and remove bookings to free up items. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, it offers a user-friendly interface with role-based access and basic security features.
